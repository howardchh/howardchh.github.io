				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p>My name is Claire Howard and I am currently a Junior at the University of South Carolina. When I came to USC my freshman year, I was an Early Childhood Education major. To make a long story short, I was bored. I thought I wanted to teach but I've always had a pull towards medicine. I am now on a pre-Physician Assistant(PA) track pursuing a B.S. in Psychology, with a minor in Neuroscience and a concentration in Medicine (I know, that's a mouthful). I am originally from Dallas, TX and basically so is my whole family. My two half-siblings, Brian and Whitney, are polar opposites and rarely get along even as they approach 35. My mom and dad have been married for 25 years and have completely different versions of how they met. Their pride and joy is not their children, but their two labradors, Harley and Tay. Our personalities seem so different, but at our core we are scarily the same: stubborn, opinionated, and loving.</p>
				<p><span id="blank"> </span><span id="more">Even though most of my family lives within 15 minutes to an hour from my house, I desperately want to move to Austin, TX. My main pull is the culture. I come off as highly analytical and left-brained, but I have a highly creative and adventurous side. On any given day you can find artists selling their pieces in Downtown Austin, live music, rich food, people swimming in Barton Springs, and social activism. I like to think of Austin as the original Nashville. But after college, I also want to travel a lot. In my gap year, my mom and I have an African safari planned, and I want to go to countries like the Netherlands, Austria, Germany, Morocco, Bhutan, and so many more. I travelled so much when I was young and I want to get back to that.</span></p>

				<h2>Future Career Plans</h2>
				<p>As previously mentioned, I am pre-PA and am taking a gap year between undergrad and PA school. I was resistant to a gap year at first, but I realized I deserve to rest and enjoy a year to experience the world. My top PA schools right now are UT Southwestern, UNC Chapel Hill (my dad's Alma Mater), and Emory. After 2 years in PA school, I can get licensed and figure out what areas of medicine I want. While I'm sure this will change by the time I complete my master's, I already know I want to specialize in Addiction Medicine. It's not a very common specialty, which is why I feel such a need to do it. Many people in my life has struggled with addiction, and I think there needs to be more conversation about it. There needs to be more empathy, and understanding-both intellectually and emotionally. I see addiction as a symptom of a much larger, American issue.</p>
				<blockquote>"Like the pandemic, fentanyl and methamphetamine present us with a huge opportunity for change...They are calling on us to embrace the ignored, the forgotten, and the despised around us, to allow them space so they might unlock their energies and abilities. When they do, like a natural resource, they will push us all forward."</blockquote>

				<p><span id="blank2"> </span><span id="more2">I have always been fascinated by the brain and behavior- why we do what we do and how the anatomy of our brains mirror our actions. I know whatever I end up doing, it will involve helping others, and giving them the opportunity to help themselves. Maybe I'll burn out of medicine and switch to social work or counseling. Patient care has always been what attracted me to the PA route, versus MD or DO. I truly believe in a mind-body connection, that our mental and physical states go hand-in-hand. I don't think the average physician has the time and resources to consider both, yet another reflection of a national problem. But the PA field is relatively new, and a benefit is being able to fill in where physicians can't. I want to see the impact I make, and that's why I think I would fit as a PA.</span><p>
